# altair_demo

Hi! Set up the repo by running the following commands from the terminal
```
$ git clone https://github.com/beingkk/altair_demo
$ conda create --name altair_demo python=3.9
$ conda activate altair_demo
$ cd altair_demo 
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And then run the tutorial notebook `tutorial_Altair_charts.ipynb`.

Feel free to use your favourite python development environment for this. For example, if you'd prefer jupyter lab, then you can install and run it by running these commands from the terminal:

```
$ pip install jupyterlab
$ jupyter lab
```

Alternatively you can run this [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1madLsAVTEG6w3Diq2M9pQRipuVMe9eEF#scrollTo=5-doehyqy8hZ) (it will have a slightly reduced functionality, eg you wonâ€™t be able to export png and svg figures).
